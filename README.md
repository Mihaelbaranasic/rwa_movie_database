# Movie Database

This is a university project developed for the course _"Web Application Development"_ (_Razvoj web aplikacija_). The project is structured in two main phases:

- **Phase 1**: Backend development using Node.js and JavaScript  
- **Phase 2**: Migration of backend code to TypeScript and frontend development using Angular and SCSS

The application demonstrates the development of a movie library that integrates with the **TMDB API** to fetch movies and TV shows. The site is secured with **JWT-based authentication**. Users can:

- Browse and search for movies  
- View movie details  
- Add or remove movies from favourites  
- Navigate through paginated results

The backend uses **SQLite** as the database, and all user passwords are securely hashed using **SHA-256**.
